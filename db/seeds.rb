infos << "A first-generation Cuban-American, he was born and raised in Little Havana, Miami’s Cuban enclave, and grew up speaking Spanish and English. In fact, he attended the first bilingual school in the US - Coral Way Elementary. After graduating from Miami High School, Jimmy left his home town (and his Cuban bubble) to study Costume Design, before transferring to Wigs & Make-Up, at North Carolina School of the Arts. It was there - surrounded by so many non-Cubans for the first time - that he fully came to appreciate and celebrate his latin heritage."
